[ ]Multiple IP camera addition
[ ]find faces in every one of them
[ ]save and load ip camera infos for later
[ ]trained groupbox has a small issue. With Loading or Training
[ ]when I get the info list I need to save that list to another list in main form because I will need every one of them later
I need to add ip cams anytime I want to.
[ ]Creating a new grid every time we adding a new IP camera???? This does not look good!!!

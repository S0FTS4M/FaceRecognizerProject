# FaceRecognizerProject
This is a c# Windows Forms Face Detection and Recognition Project. 
If you select Camera menu you will see 3 diffirent Camera Types
For Using WebCam select it from the menu.
If you want to select another camera that you connected to computer you can try different indexes. Select Indexed Camera and start from 0.
If you want to add Ip camera Select it from the menu. you will see a form showed up you can fill ip cam infos and you can click Add list for adding
more than one camera. When you finish click add button and start to use.
For now adding multpile ip cameras is not avaliable and I dont know if ip camera actually works. I didnt test it yet. If you test it let me know
and write the camera type too.
Thanks for reading this.

If you add the link of my github profile when you use the code, that would be so nice and cool :D
